# Web UI — Healthcare Knowledge Navigator

A friendly Next.js front end for non-technical users. Ask a question in plain
language, get an answer with clickable source citations, and see a **What's New**
feed of recent changes.

## Run locally

```bash
cd web
cp .env.example .env.local      # point NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL at the backend
npm install
npm run dev                     # http://localhost:3000
```

The backend (FastAPI) must be running and reachable at `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`
(default `http://localhost:8000`). See the project root README for the backend.

## Pages

| Route | What it does |
|-------|--------------|
| `/` | Ask box + example questions; renders the answer and its source citations |
| `/whats-new` | Plain-language release notes, pulled live from the repo's GitHub Releases |

## Deploy

Deployable to Vercel as-is (root directory `web/`). Set the two
`NEXT_PUBLIC_*` env vars in the Vercel project. The backend can run anywhere
reachable over HTTPS (a container host, Fly, Render, etc.).

## Config

Domain-specific copy (title, accent colour, example questions, repo) lives in
[`lib/config.ts`](lib/config.ts) — the only file that differs between the three
sister projects.
