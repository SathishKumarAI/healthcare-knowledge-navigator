## [Unreleased]
### Added
- **GPU + no-Docker deployment.** New-device setup now has two paths (Docker / native)
  each in CPU or GPU mode, on Windows/RTX, Linux, and macOS. Added `Dockerfile.gpu`
  (CUDA 12.4 + torch cu124 + OCR stack), `docker-compose.gpu.yml` (reserves the GPU for
  API + Ollama), `scripts/setup.sh` / `scripts/setup.ps1` native bootstrappers,
  `.dockerignore`, and `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`. Embeddings and the F17 reranker now honor
  `EMBED_DEVICE` / `RERANK_DEVICE` (`auto` = cuda→mps→cpu) via new `app/device.py`.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-23
### Added
- RAG pipeline: ingest (load → chunk → embed → Chroma), retrieval, and grounded
  answers with `[n]` citations mapped to real source passages.
- Pluggable model providers via a `PROVIDER` switch: open-source Ollama + HuggingFace
  embeddings (default, free) or Claude + Voyage.
- FastAPI service: `/v1/ask`, `/v1/ask/stream` (SSE), `/v1/ingest`, `/v1/sources`,
  `/health`, `/ready`, `/metrics`.
- Production concerns: API-key auth + rate limiting, structured JSON logging with
  request IDs, Prometheus metrics, answer + embedding caching.
- Evaluation harness (retrieval hit-rate + LLM-as-judge faithfulness) wired as a CI gate.
- Next.js web UI for non-technical users (Ask page + What's New page).
- Containerization (multi-stage non-root Dockerfile + compose) and CI (ruff, mypy,
  pytest, docker build).
- Full doc kit under `docs/` (architecture, specs F01–F15, security, runbook, ADRs).
